# AccessPath
AccessPath designed to help citizens report accessibility issues for pedestrians, particularly for those with disabilities. Users can easily flag problems like broken paths, blocked areas, or missing tactile paving. This helps people better plan their route and also informs the city on where they should prioritize repairs.
Did all the HTML and Javascript code and did some of the CSS code. I also was in charge of setting up the database with PHP, SQL, and MySQL using InfinityFree.
